StatMediaWiki is a GPL-licensed stable and fully-functional software to collect and aggregate information available in a MediaWiki installation.

StatMediaWiki is coded in Python, so it needs a Python interpreter to run. It additionally requires the python-gnuplot package. It can be easily installed in an Debian-based distribution using aptitude or Synaptic.

The system needs read-access to the MediaWiki installation database. Connection settings are stored in ~/.my.cnf (in the HOME directory):

user = user_able_to_read_the_db
password = user_password
host = bbdd_host

StatMediaWiki supports the following options:
* --outputdir: absolute path to the directory where the report will be generated (by default, "output")
* --index: name of the main (initial) file of the report (by default, "index.php")
* --sitename: name of the wiki that will be shown on the title of the report
* --siteurl: URL of the wiki
* --subdir: path that has to be added to the URL to get to the wiki (by default "/index.php")
* --dbname: name of the database of the wiki
* --tableprefix: prefix of the tables in the database (only required if indicated one when installing MediaWiki)
* --anonymous: make an anonymous analysis (hiding user names and other details, see below)

StatMediaWiki has two operation modes: standard and anonymous

* Standard analysis: the lines in the content evolution charts may fall (they do not have to be strictly increasing). That can be caused because the content of a certain page decreases (for example, because some paragraphs are joined and simplified). However, user contribution never falls, as it counts user contributions: when the user writes in the wiki, he contributes, no matter if later on the text is erased or modified.

* Anonymous analysis: there is no HTML chart for any specific user, so the "graphs/users" and "html/users" directories are empty. Nicknames are anonymized in the ranking of the whole site, and have no links. In the analysis of each page, the user ranking is left empty: otherwise, it would be trivial to mine the identities of the users from it.

This is a sample invocation to StatMediaWiki:
 python /home/user/statmediawiki.py --outputdir="/home/user/analysis/mywiki" --sitename=MyWiki --siteurl=http://mywiki.org --dbname=wikidb
