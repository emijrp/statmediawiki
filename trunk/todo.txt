This is the to-do wishlist ;-)

* Generate work distribution by categories. This way we can observe how the different categories grew during time
* Color cells in category ranking of the overall wiki report
* Generate Pareto charts
* Generate Pie charts
* Generate dynamic charts
* Generate deeper statistics, suggestions are welcome!

* Although the tables can be copied/pasted in OpenOffice (indicating tabular as field separator), a link for CSV donwload would be better

* Add .bib files to the papers descriptions
